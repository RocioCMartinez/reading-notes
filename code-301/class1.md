# Introduction to React and Components

This reading is introducing us to a broader view of software design, component level. It seems like the main point is to understand that a component is a building block that houses smaller information or functions. Components can be created or reused from an existing library, it is much easier to work with a block at a time and reuse other blocks that are available to you.

## Component-Based Architecture Questions

1. What is a “component”?
2. What are the characteristics of a component?
3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

## Answers

1. A component can be defined in mulitple ways when it comes to software. It is a function/object/concept that is the main part of sub items. It is structured out and well defined, it can deploy independently working as a higher-level interface.
2. The characteristics of a component are; Reusbility, Replacable, Not context specific, Extensible, Encapsulated, and Independent.
3. The advantages of using component-based architecture are; Ease of deployment, Reduced cost, Ease of development, Reusable, Modification of technical complexity, Reliability, System maintenance and evolution, and Independent.

## Props/React Questions

1. What is “props” short for?
2. How are props used in React?
3. What is the flow of props?

## Answer

1. "Props" is short for *properties*, very important in React.
2. Props are used to pass data from a component to another.
3. The flow of props is a **unidirectional flow** (One way, in the direction of parent to child). Props is read-only, meaning the child components cannot make changes.

## Things I want to know more about

*"React is a component-based library that divides the UI into little reusable pieces."*

What is a UI in this context?
