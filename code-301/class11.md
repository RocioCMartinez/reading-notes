# MongoDB and Mongoose

Todays reading covers different databases. There is a table vs document structure to these data bases. Both have pros and cons so it will depend on needs.

## NoSQL vs SQL

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL

- called Relational Datbases(RDBMS)

- table based

- Vertically scalable

- Good for complex queries

- Not a good fit for hierarchical data storage

NoSQL

- called non-rational or distributed database

- document based (key-value pairs, graphs, wide-column stores)

- horizontally scalable

- Not a good fit for complex queries

- Good fit for hierarchical data due to the use of key value pairs

What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

Non-complex, hierarchical data. Mainly data that can be replicated.

Give a real world example.

Used in major platforms like Windows, Mac, and Solaris.

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

Document like data (ex. JSON), simple queries.

Give a real world example.

Used by Craigslist and MTV Networks.

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

SQL

Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL

## SQL ns NoSQL Video

1. What does SQL stand for?
2. What is a relational database?
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
4. What is a ‘schema’?
5. What is a NoSQL database?
6. How does it work?
7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

## Response

1. Structured Query Language.
2. A database that works in a certain way based on relations.
3. Tables structure.
4. The schematic outline of data.
5. A no sequal database.
6. Saves information in document like structure (like JSON).
7. Use of collections.
8. MongoDB because there is no schema.
9. The main disadvantage is duplicate data, updates need to happen in all instances the data can be found in.
