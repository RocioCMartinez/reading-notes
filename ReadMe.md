### **Rocio Martinez: Growth Mindset**

What sticks out to me when thinking of a **growth mindset** is *effort, positivity,* and *resources*!
It is the constant work we put in when trying to reach a state of  understanding. When applied to a positive outlook it becomes a goal or a dream that we can look forward to achieving. Your surroundings all become a resource. Not only the physical tools but the people around you too. Think of others who are 'thriving' as healthy competition or inspiration. At the end of the day if it has been done before, that means it's not impossible! 

### 3 Reminders or Self Affirmations

1. Effort: Hard work always pays off! Keep trying.
2. Positivity: At the end of the day, I ***will*** go to bed. No need to take frustrations everywhere you go.
3. Resources: Use what was provided as it has a purpose.
