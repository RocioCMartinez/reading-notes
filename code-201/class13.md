# Class 13 Notes

This reading is about local storage. I learned that there are still a lot of issues with storing user data that have not been resolved. 

Use of cookies is a way data is stored on web pages but has many downsides. Limited to 4KB of data, slows web application, and send unencrypted data.

Local storage is also known as HTML5 or Web storage.

Manipulated with `getItem()`/`setItem()` and `removeItem()` methods.

## Storage-Websites

1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
2. What information should not be stored in local storage?
3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

## Responses

1. Local storage can help keep a key on users computer that becomes active once the user returns. Records named key/value pairs.
2. Any data obtained without consent (like spying through use of cookies).
3. Local storage can store web service data. It would need to be cached on the computer through the use of local storage.
