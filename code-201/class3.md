# Class3 Notes

This reading is important because it helps explain boxes and arrays. When understanding boxes it is easier to manipulate the display of a website. Arrays are like super lists giving more qualities to the list items. Lists are a basic elements but one that is used often due to functionality. Unordered and ordered list have important individual properties and can exist in each other. Loops and conditions can help make a webpage more functional and can produce results much faster.

## List Questions

1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?
2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?
3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?
4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

## List Answers

1. Unordered lists are used when items need to be grouped together but sequence is not a factor.
2. The bullet style can be changed with the **type** attribute.
3. An ordered list should be used when the order or sequence matters. If the order or steps do not need to be in sequence you may use an unordered list.
4. You can change the order of numbers by using the **reverse** attribute (high to low). The **start** attribute can aid in using letters or Roman numerals to organize lists.

## CSS Questions

1. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story.  What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?
2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

## CSS Answers

1. The Box Model Story

Margin is like a penguin keeping an egg alive. It can move on the Artic floor bringing along the egg just like a margin can be moved on a page and bring along its content, padding, and border. Content is the fetus, padding is like the fluid inside the egg keeping the fetus safe and protected. The border is the shell holding in the content and the padding. 

2. The four parts of an HTML elements box;

- The *content* box- area that displays content.
- The *padding* box- White space around the content.
- The *border* box- box that engulfs the padding and content within.
- The *margin* box- outter most layer, engulfs the previous layers in white space against other elements.


## JS Qustions

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?
2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?
3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.
5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.
6. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.

## JS Answers

1. An array can store many data types; numbers, strings, objects, and other arrays.
2. The people array is not a valid JS array because there are multiple null items. Each item holds a number value dependent on sequence order, having the multiple nulls would create issues with this.
3. There are many types of assignment shorthand operators.

- += is the addition assignment it can add two operands or concatenate.
- /= the division assignment, it will divide the two operands and assign  result to left operand.
- &&= the logical AND assignment evaluates and will assign if left is truthy.
- *= multiplication assignment, multiplies two operands assigns result to left operand.
- = the assignment operator gives value to a variable.

4. There is no result due to mixing data type values or result is false because (10 + false) equals false, and (false + 'dog') would still equal false.
5. A conditional statement should be used when evaluating a test score. Dependant on the number of correct answers a score can be generated.
6. A loop is useful when allowing access. If the user input is not identical to a password value a loop can allow multiple tries or deny access.
A loop is useful in JS because it will run multiple iterations of code. It can help draw circles or keep track of a sum.
