# Class2 Notes

This reading featured more details about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Helped define condition and logical operators. The importance of functions and how to identify components of CSS.

## HTML Questions

1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?
2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?
3. What are some uses for the sup and sub elements?
4. When using the abbr element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

## Answers to HTML

1. It is important to use semantic elements because it is the proper way to write HTML. Makes it easier for anyone to interpret.
2. There are 6 levels of headings, h1 being the main.
3. Superscript/Subscript. Can correctly express dates, chem formulas, or math equations.
4. The title attribute would be used to provide full expansion of the term.

## CSS Questions

1. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?
2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?

- Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:

1. What is representing the selector?
2. Which components are the CSS declarations?
3. Which components are considered properties?

## Answers to CSS

1. There are 3 ways to apply CSS; external stylesheet, internal stylesheet, and inline style.
2. We should avoid because it is the least efficient form. Can lead to mix ups between the CSS code, HTML, and the content.

- Review

1. The selector is: h2 (level 2 header)
2. CSS declartions components are: color, padding (applies to color of text and spacing in block area)
3. Components that are considered properties are: black, 5px

## JS Questions

1. What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?
2. List 4 types of JavaScript operators.
3. Describe a real world problem you could solve with a Function

## Answers to JS

1. A string data type.
2. 4 types of operators; 

- Addition (either adds 2 numbers or combines strings)
- Subtraction/Multiplication/Division (have mathematical functions)
- Assignment = (used to assign a value to a variable)
- Strict equality === (Compares values and data types returns true/false aka Boolean)
- Not, Does not equal !(Changes the return to the opposite outcome)

3. There are many world problms that are being solved with functions. An example is using a calculator app to obtain a result. I could also be alerted when typing a password incorrectly. 

## Conditionals-Questions

1. An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.
2. What is the use of an else if?
3. List 3 different types of comparison operators.
4. What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?

## Answers to Conditionals

1. An *if* statement checks a **condition** and if it evaluates to **true**, then the code block will execute.
2. The use of *else if* is to provide extra choices before resorting to *else*.
3. Comparison operators test conditions.

- === or !== (identical or not identical, to include data type)
- < and > (compares the values from each side dictating greater than or less than)
- <= and => (does the same as above but can now be equal as well)

4. && is the AND logical operator (must have true expressions on each side to be true outcome)
|| is the OR logical operator (if any expression is true the outcome is now true)

## Things I want to know more about

Need to understand the span element a little more, like practical use.
