# Psychological Safety

## Discussion Questions

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

## Responses

1. The two main factors I gathered from the reading would have to be communication and empathy, but it seemed like diversity was also a big contributing factor.
2. I have been in a setting where I feel psycohologically safe and not at the same time. During my time in the Army I worked in a shop of biomed technicians there were about 11 total members. As a large team we could not get along well, our assigned leader hated being in the leadership position. He would not communicate well or allow us to feel like a team, for example things I felt were important to discuss before taking action were not talked about at all. We were simply given assignments, there was no difference of outcome if the job was done well or poorly. Now I had a team of 3 soldiers that I worked with. As a smaller group we would talk about our day in the morning. We would discuss what we planned to do for work that day. We would compromise or take on each others work depending on what worked best to complete the job. We felt like we could not get the same interaction with other memebers in the shop.
3. The impact is massive. Individuals begin to enjoy, feel a sense of pride and ownership when it comes to their work. They feel valued, heard, and safe to express both ideas and sorrows. There is no worry of critizism. Overall this makes employees work harder and more efficiently together.
