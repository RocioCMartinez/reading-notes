# Class 8 Notes

This reading convers new features in CSS, the flexbox and it gives an explanation of how it works and also highlights caution with use due to accessibily conflicts.

## CSS-Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

## Flexbox Answers

1. It means that it can manipulate one-dimensional content or pretty much anything in an HTML as that is also reserved for one-dimensional content. Since it can adjust size, boarders, and space it needs to work with simple content to have a good output.
2. The main axis is determined by the flex-direction, once that is established (either row or coloumn) the cross axis will take on the opposite role of the main axis.
3. Using certain properties of flexbox can negatively impact accessability because of display order vs logical order. Accessibility tools like screen readers will follow a logical order where the display could be different from that.

## CSS Layout-Flexbox

1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

## Answers

1. Using flexbox over float is more convinient and easier to manipulate. Flexbox will help automatically center or resize items based on parent elements or content. Float would take a lot of adjustments to achieve the same thing.
2. This topic is going to be so helpful when trying to design the layout of a page and I am all about making my life easier. I am interested in seeing the flexbox in action.
