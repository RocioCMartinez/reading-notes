# Class 10 Notes

This class reading targets how to look at errors in code and where to start when it comes to addressing them. It turns out there are a lot of tools available to developers in the inspect menu.

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

## Answers

1. Syntax errors are spelling errors in code and usually come with a message. Logical errors are where syntax is right but the outcome is not what was intended and are much harder errors to fix, lack error message for direction.
2. I have gotten a lot of syntax errors like missing colon or parenthesis or not using a variable. I usually look for the JavaScript line number the error is pointing to and address the issue there.
3. This topic will always play a role in the future. I will make many many mistkes in the days to come but understanding the type of error and where to start looking for the solution are key elements to take away.

## JavaScript Debugger

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
2. Define what a breakpoint is.
3. What is the call stack?

## Answer

1. The dubugger tool helps you run code in portions which can help when trying to isolate the portion that is causing a certain problem.
2. A breakpoint is the stopping point for a certain portion of code to run up until. (Stops execution)
3. The call stack is a section that will display the code executed to get to current line.
