## CSS Questions

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

## CSS Answers

1. Normal flow is the default manner a browser will lay out HTML pages. HTML content will be displayed in order and elements stacked on top of each other(block).
2. Block-level means stacked one over the other while inline elements means in rows or side by side.
3. Static positioning is the default.
4. The advantge of using absolute positioning is that it creates an area of isolation on the page that is not affected by other element. In this area UI features can exist without interfering with layout. Examples would be control menus, rollover panels, or popup info boxes.
5. The key difference would be the relative term they use. Fixed positioning will fix an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. Absolute positioning will fix an element in place realtive to its nearest positioned ancestor(or inital contain block if no ancestor found).

## JS Questions

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

## JS Answers

1. The difference between declaring a function and invocation is activation. Declaring a function states the terms but invocation is actually using it.
2. Perameters are pieces of information a function needs to do its job properly. An argument can be a variable or something of value through function invocation.

## Miscellaneous Question

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

Two benefits to pair programming that could help me are **greater efficiency** and **social skills**. Greater efficiency is always the goal when doing anything. Combining knowledge with someone else could help complete projects faster. We have been given a lot of information and I know that my classmates have all retained different parts of this information plus there is the benefits of experience and tips! Developing my social skills further is also important to me. I have to learn how to work in a non-military atmosphere. This will allow me to have more cohesion with others.
