# Class5 Notes

Note: A figure can be multiple media files not just images. Can be audio, video, table, or code snippet.

HTML images are important because of screen readers and descriptions. CSS images are mainly for decoration and will be ignored by a screen reader.
Meaning = HTML image, Decoration = CSS image

Web design is trying to be inclusive, consider page readers or visual impairments a user may have.


## HTML Media

1. What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?
2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
3. Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.
4. Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

## Answers

1. alt attribute is Alternative Text, it helps describe an image through text. This is helpful when you are having issues loading a page, the alt attribute will provide a description of the image so you have an understanding of what is supposed to populate.
2. You could improve accessibility by using an alt attribute or a blank attribute if description is already in content. You could also do other things like adjust size (width, height) or add a title with more information but it is not recommended, but you could!
3. The `<figure>` element should be used with the `<figcaption>` element, this will help provide a caption(description) and to link the image and caption together keeping things in order. This is useful when there are multiple images and you want to provide multiple captions.
4. There is an important difference between a gif image and an svg image, basically how simple or complex is it? A gif image is the best suite for simple images this means low color properties and size is not really a factor. An svg image is more complex because it needs to adjust to remain readable or display higher resolution.
5. I would use a PNG because it can allow better display of any text.

## CSS Answers

1. The foreground is the content or text while the background is simply the space behind it. It is important to have access to these because you want to select colors that contrast each other to make text or content readable against the background color.
2. There are many ways to add color. Background color is the easiest and biggest change but you can maipulate the color of text or create different colored borders. Text decoration can also be colored.
3. You should consider the properties of the font like size or special styling like bold or italic.
4. Font-size is going to determine the size of the text, font-wight will determine how bold the text will appear, and font-style is used to turn text italic.
5. You could add spacing through text-align, if centered text will have space arouond it. You could also adjust the padding or margin size around text.
