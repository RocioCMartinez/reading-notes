1. A repeting trend to build out or do something. In the biomedical field there are a lot of concepts that would be considered a design pattern, for example we have specific documentation needed for all radiology equipment.

2. Singleton is a **design pattern** that will ensure *one* object to a class.

## Things I want to know more about

I would say more about the static concept. I feel like I understand a bit of it but I will forget easily which means I am lacking concrete information to hold on to.
