# Graphs

## [Graphs](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/graphs.html)

The graph structure reminded me a bit of an evidence board where you piece together clues.

Clues would be considered the nodes/vertices.

The connections linking clues together would be the edges.
Some of these connections can be directed like one clue in specific leading you to find another piece of evidence (data flow).

There is a narritive to be built, in a similar manner a graph helps devs look at data points and component interaction to create the bigger picture of the apps functionality.

There is a path or pattern to the order of how evidence is gathered, like a graph cycle.

There will also be the management of evidence, like a graph database.

An evidence board would help a detective piece together a complicated case, and a graph can help devs unravel the relationships and dependencies among various components.
