# RecyclerView

[Displaying lists of data: Recyclerview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview#java)

What makes a RecyclerView dynamic?

The process of binding, taking data and associating it with views. Instead of hardcoded data a view is like the template to display all the data in the same format.
