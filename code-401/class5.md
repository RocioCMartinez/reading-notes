# Implementation: Linked Lists

If I had to explain linked lists I would say it is like running a trail. You have a starting point and as you go down the trail you will get checkpoints (*nodes*) that give you information on the current location. You can run the trail the simples way which is linearly each checkpoint will give you *data* to your point and will reference the distance to the *"next node"*, I mean checkpoint. I feel like last node referencing null is still applicable as the runner hasn't made is out there. It is important to remember that a node or a checkpoint in my analogy only cares about its position and the next checkpoint, not order or start point, ensure *head* is at start point. The is basically where you chose to start the run.

Hope this helps
