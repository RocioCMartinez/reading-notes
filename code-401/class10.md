# Stacks&Queues

Both follow these concepts:

FIFO- First In First Out
LILO- Last In Last Out

My analogy:

What helped me visualize this concept would be a pez dispencer the candy must enter in a certain order and the first one in would be the last one out. It literally **pops** candy out and you need to **push** candy in if you want there to be more. Much like the head of a Linkedlist it is important to have the concept of **Top/Front**. This is a position we can access to start manipulating items (candy/nodes). We also have a new peek that tells us what the next will be in order for us to move top and pop off the old top if we needed to. We get a new ability to check if the stack or queue is `isEmpty` but the result literally answers the question. If its empty you will get *true* if it is not empty you will get *false*.
