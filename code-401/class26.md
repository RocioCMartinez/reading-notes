What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.

From ChatGPT:
*"In Android Studio, an Intent is a fundamental concept that represents an abstract description of an operation to be performed. It is primarily used for communication between different components of an Android application, such as activities, services, and broadcast receivers. Intents can be used to start activities, launch services, deliver broadcasts, and more. They enable you to describe what you want to do, without needing to know the specifics of how it will be done."*

Fresh examples:

Opening a new page can be done through a button or link.

Sharing content, an intent can trigger the sharing process.

Describe an Activity in your own words.

An activity is like a page but for a mobile app. It provides visuals and interaction points for the users. Each one is separate and tailor for specific tasks.
