# Hash Tables

The analogy that makes more sense would be a magic library.

In the library there is a librarian who will help you find books quickly. The library is organized by genres and shelves.

You go to the librarian to ask for a specific book, the librarian has a special book (hash table), they look up the title (key) and get the shelf its located at (value).

The library is the overall data collection, genres are like buckets, each shelf is like a slot in a bucket, magic book is the hash table with the book titles and shelf numbers needed to retrieve the book(data).
