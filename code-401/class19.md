# Functional Programming

## [Purely functional programming, from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming)

Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?

You can, but only if the state variable is within the scope of the function. Cannot change it from a global scope scale.

Define purely functional programming.

Purely functional programming is focusing on mathematical functions for all computations. The function depends on its arguments and has no scope of anything outside of it.

How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs youâ€™ve written so far in this course?

I think it would be an adjustment coming from JavaScript and React, we are given a lot of flexibility. Java becomes more strict and now it seems like purely functional programming is the highest level of a strict design. This can be good because you are required to know exactly what is happening in the function and there is no ambiguity in the result. I would need more experience with it to really evaluate the differences.
