# Android and Espresso

- [Android SharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences)

- [Espresso Testing](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso)

- [Ridiculous superpower: the Espresso Test Recorder](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/espresso-test-recorder)

- [Android Tasks and the Back Stack](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/tasks-and-back-stack)

What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?

The technology that I've used that is similar to Shared Preferences would have to be the use of local storage. Since it is remembering some basic settings/info.

Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.

To record UI interactions.
To verify UI elements.
For debugging.
Check view, view assertions, view actions.

I feel like the most important would be for UI interactions/debuggin. This can help lead you to edge cases that had not been considered.

Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.

The back stack reminds me of the call stack when iterating a tree recursively.

An analogy would be the stack of plates at a buffet. You would pick up a plate to get started on getting food. Once you are done with a plate you get rid of the one thats completed and go grab another one and start over. If you are preparing a plate for someone else so need two plates you grab two and switch off between which one you are focusing on, but only one is being addressed at a time.
