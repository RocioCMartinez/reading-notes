## XKCD: Compiling

1. Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript.
2. Does code complining mean that it works correctly?

## Answers

1. Compiling is converting the code that has been written by developers (human readable code) to what is needed by computers to read and execute (machine code).

2. It does not. As part of the reading example we saw how you could write a correctly formatted expression but the expression result itself was incorect.
