# Discussion Questions

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

The Big-O concept would come into play here. Understanding the time and space complexity. This will be very challanging and must come from practice.

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

Defining the termination point, whether that is a line of code or break in loop. Anything that will ensure an end to the sequence.

## Things I want to know more about

I would have to say some varying examples of different Big-O combinations.
