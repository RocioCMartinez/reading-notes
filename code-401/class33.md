Asynchronous mechanisms: callbacks, promises, and async/await labels.

Describe asynchronous actions in your own words.

Asynchronous actions recognize that an action will require time to be completed and so they allow a program to continue while they run in the background.

I mainly recall promises. Its like when you take clothes to the dry cleaners, they give you a ticket and you go on with your life, but there is a promise that your clothes will be ready and awaiting you on the time and date specified on the ticket. When the time comes (task is complete) your back at the drycleaners focused on that task again.

What is the benefit of asynchronous methods?

The benefit is the program will not be blocked/unresponsive until the asynchonous task is completed.
