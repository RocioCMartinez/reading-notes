# Java Basics

Todays reading covers more information on Java basics. We reviewed more details about primitive/reference values. We viewed exceptions and how to handle them. Finally how to use a scanning program.

## [Primitive vs. Objects](https://www.baeldung.com/java-primitives-vs-objects)

1. Explain the difference between an “int” and an “Integer” in Java.
2. What is the default value for ints? Integers?
3. What is autoboxing? Unboxing?

## Answers

1. int is a primitive while Integer is a reference type.

2. The default value for int would be *o*. For Integers it would be *null*.

3. Converting a primitive to a reference is autoboxing, going from reference to primitive is unboxing.

## [Exceptions in Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/index.html)

1. List the three basic categories of exceptions.
2. What type of statement can you use to handle an exception?

## Response

1. The 3 basic categories of exceptions are the *checked exception*, the *error*, and the *runtime exception*.

2. You could use a try statement to catch exception. A finally block is another option.

## [Using Scanner to read in a file in Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/scanning.html)

1. Describe a situation where you think it would be useful to have a program that scans text.
2. What is input from a Scanner broken down into?

## Answer

1. I'm not sure, I would say maybe a typing program that can compare each token value to the user input token value.

2. Input from a scanner gets broken down into tokens this is usually based on whitespace but could also target other values like a comma followed by a whitespace.

## Things I want to know more about

The importance of scanners and their use, had a hard time visualizing examples.
