# Java: DRY, Rule of Three, Minimum Viable Product

- DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself, the concept of replacing repetitive information with abstractions that are not likely to change. Or use of data normalization to avoid redundancy.

- The rule of three = *"Three strikes and you refactor"*, rule of thumb to ensure code is not being repetitive and therefore easier to maintain.

- You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI), comes from exteme programming (XP), stating that programmers should not add functionality until it is necessary. The concept of static design before adding dynamic features.

- Minimum Viable Product(MVP), a test like version of a product that includes **just** enough fetures to be usable. Can be used to aquire feedback for future product development.

## [Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) & Consider the [Rule of Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming))

 Are there any projects that youâ€™ve built during your time at Code Fellows (or prior) which could benefit from applying the Rule of Three to DRY up your code?

I am sure that there are but since I needed all the practice with concepts and with typing, I did not mind. The big ones would be any projects we did before we learned about constructors.

 Explain how you would dry up your code if you noticed that you are repeating the same logic in multiple places?

 I would now look into using abstractions, creating a general shell that applies to multiple concepts that way the bulk of the work is taken care of and we can still do minor customization if needed.

Describe some benefits of releasing an MVP of a product.

Some benefits are getting feedback to see if the product is well recieved and spending the least amount of time and money to test a product. Can also generate interest for future investments.

What are some potential pitfalls of waiting until a product is fully mature to release it.

The potential pitfall would be wasted time, effort, and money. If a fully matured product is not well recieved, likely a lot of adjustments would need to be made which will equal more time, effort, and money going into it.
