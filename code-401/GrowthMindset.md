# GrowthMindset Readings/Assessments

## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice

- This reading served as a reminder that growth takes work. Once you become complacent in your job your skills and professional growth can come to a hault. It is important to personally challenge yourself and set goals that will take you further than your current job position has.
- I need to checkout *The Matasano Crypto Challenge* or *Rosalind* if I stop feeling challenged.

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

- This was a TED talk video on the topic of growth mindset. The main points I gathered from this was thee concept of 'not yet' vs now. This is the idea that you don't have to perform every challenge correctly because you can learn and be optimistic about getting it right in the future. We need to praise wisely, as in not just the result but the effort and process one takes to get there.

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

- This was another TED talk video regarding the power of passion and perserverance. Basically it was evaluating extensive researched done around individuals and success. The bottom line was that individuals who understood long terms goals and were able to keep stamina were the ones who succeeded. The concept of teaching others how the brain works and that it must evolve and grow and how that affected their personal efforts/achievements was very interesting. I would have liked to know about these topics as a child but here we are now.

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

- Another TED talk video, this one was a little harder for me to decipher. It covers how the media and society will look at successful individuals and 'losers'. How tragedy and underachievements are on the same relm but in different spectrums. Bottom line here was that you, as an individual entity, must focus your thoughts and define success for yourself in order to reach fulfillment in life.

## Emotional Intelligence Assessment

- My strong point here was Self-Management which makes sense since I feel the most control over myself in life. I have learned to be comprehensive and patient.
- My weak point was Social-Awareness, not to say I'm terrible in this aspect. I can admit that I will tend to avoid social settings. I am currently working on feeling at ease at social events. I am very empathetic and will feel overwhelmed with trying to gauge a lot of people at one time.

## Bias Assessment

- My strongest scoring category was Bias and the Brain. This to me was understanding that bias naturally exists and the main form of overcoming this is acceptance, communication, and empathy moving forward.
- My weak point was in the four ways to act section. I believe this to be influenced a bit by my military background. I need to acknowledge that I am now in a position where I can intervene more freely and walk away from any situation making me uncomfortable.
- Overall I am still working on allowing myself to be more authentic and creative now.

## Things I want to know more about

- Why is the concept of growth such a phenomenon? I often think of my plants and how they are affected by everything in their environment and will compare myself to them. I am in need of inspiration, sunlight, water/food, and care in order to grow to my full potential.
