# Discussion Questions & Response

## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

> My answer would have to be dedication. I accept that I will not be the best at everything but I will find the things I am the best at in that role.

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- Learning when to walk away. Sometimes we need to come back to a problem with fresh eyes in order to make progress.

- Seek help, help not answers. Explain your dilema to someone and see if they can guide you to the answer you need. (15 mins then TA right?)

- Being in the right mindset and atmosphere. If you need to be alone to focus do that. If you need to listen to classical music like myself, do that. Be prepared for what you are doing eat, sleep, exercise, anything you need.
