###**Rocio-Martinez:Growth Development**

What sticks out to me when thinking of a **growth mindset** is 
*effort, positivity, and resources!*
It is the constant work we put in when trying to reach a state of  understanding. When applied to a positive outlook it becomes a goal or a dream that we can look forward to achieving. Your surroundings all become a resource. Not only the physical tools but the people around you too. Think of others who are thriving as healthy competition or insperation. At the end of the day, if it has been done before that means it's not impossible!
